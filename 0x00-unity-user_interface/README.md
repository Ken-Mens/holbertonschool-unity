# 0x00. Unity - User Interface

## Background Context

This project will go over the basics of Unity’s user interface. For this project, import Unity’s Standard Assets package from the Asset Store. Open one of the sample scenes and use it to play around with the windows, layouts, options, navigation methods, etc. covered in the reading. It’s necessary to get a feel for what tools are at your disposal and what they do before you use them! It will also make it easier to answer this project’s tasks.
